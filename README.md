## How to Play

1. The program generates a random 4-digit number between 1000 and 9999.
2. You have **10 attempts** to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the game will tell you how many digits you guessed correctly and if they are in the correct position.
4. If you guess all digits correctly, you win!
5. If you fail to guess the number within 10 attempts, you lose and the correct number will be displayed.

### Input Validation
- You must input exactly a 4-digit number.
- Non-numeric inputs or numbers not exactly 4 digits long are invalid and will prompt an error message without counting as an attempt.

## Features

- Provides feedback after each guess on how many digits were correct.

- Displays the correct number if the user fails to guess within the limit.
